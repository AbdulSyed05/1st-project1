## Features

### General Features

- Responsive on all devices, so users get the best, tailored experience for the specific way they access the website.
- Clearly interactive pages so that users know what actions to take, and how to take them, at every point 

### Button Styled Links

- Page links like Read More and Volunteer are styled as big buttons so users clearly see them, and can easily tap them on mobile devices, to go to the appropriate page.

### Volunteer Form

- The volunteer form allows users to input contact information, and make a selection between different areas of volunteering, so they can note their preference.
- All input fields apart from the checkbox are required, so users can avoid partial, incomplete submission of details.
- The submit button provides user feedback for hover, and click, so they know an action has been taken.

### Newsletter Modal

- The newsletter sign up modal is a quick pop up, allowing the user to input their details, and join our mailing list.
- The submit button provides user feedback for hover, and click, so they know an action has been taken.

### Content Loops

- Each news or patient story is separately hosted but links to another, similar story, so interested users can continue to read clearly communicated content.

### Downloadable Content and External Links

- Downloadable content on the About Us page, and in the footer, opens in a separate tab so the user can read it later at leisure without interrupting their visit.

## Features left to implement

### Donation Functionality

- A donation function is planned for later roll outs. It would work through use of a button styled link and form similar to the existing volunteer functionality would be enabled on the website. This would allow users to support the Mater Foundation through a once off or regular donation.

### Confirmation Emails for Volunteer Sign-Up, Newsletter Sign-Up

- Further to the user feedback elements that exist, a confirmation email feature is planned for later roll outs. It would be linked to submission of both the volunteer form, and the newsletter sign up form, and would trigger an email confirmation to users who've submitted so that they know their submission was received.
